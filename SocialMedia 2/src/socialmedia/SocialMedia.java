    /**
     The users, i.e., accounts registered in the system, will be able to post original messages
     and comments, which can also be endorsed by endorsement posts.
     Accounts have a unique numerical identifier, but also a unique string handle to be more easily identified throughout
     the system. They can have a description field to add personal information they want to share. Posts (original,
     comments, and endorsements) have a unique numerical identifier and contain a message with up to 100-characters.
     The post ID is a sequential number such that its ordering is a proxy for a postâ€™s chronology. They are always associated
     with an author, i.e., the account who posted it. To allow the creation of meaningful conversation trees, posts must keep
     track of the list of endorsements and comments they received. Endorsements and comments are also categorized as
     posts, but with special features. For instance, comments always have to point to another post (original or comment).
     Endorsements automatically replicate the endorsed message and also refer to original or comment posts. Endorsements
     are not endorsed or commented. The system should provide basic analytics such as the most popular post and the
     most popular account.
